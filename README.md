 <h3 align="justify"> <i>This was a request from a great friend, so I think it's fair to put the specs requested by him here.

It's a simple project, but I got a snack for it ;p</i></h3>
<h3 align="justify"> <i> I'm posting this project after having implemented all the changes that I always propose after posting a project here. So it already has a rules popup, responsive for any desktop, two languages (English and Portuguese), buttons for my socials and all sorts of silly details.<br><br> </i> </h3>

<h3 align="justify"><i>Perhaps the most interesting function is the language switch, where I use an increment (+1) along with a check if it's odd or even (%2) to switch between languages.</i></h3>
